" Timeout for mapped sequences (milliseconds)
" Affects how long Vim waits for the next key in a mapping.
" 1000ms is default. 100ms is very short, adjust if you have slow multi-key mappings.

" Quick save and run
" nnoremap: non-recursive mapping in Normal mode
nnoremap <leader>w :w<CR>
" This mapping is a bit unusual. '@:' repeats the last command-line command.
" So, leader+r will save and then repeat whatever your last :command was.
" If you intend to, for example, run the current file, you'd need something more specific.
" For Elixir, it might be: nnoremap <leader>r :w \| !mix run %<CR> (example)
nnoremap <leader>r :w \| @:<CR>
